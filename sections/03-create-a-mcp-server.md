Please create a local STDIO MCP (model context protocol) server using nodejs in this folder.
It's a QR code generator loal MCP server, and the generated QR code will be written to a specific path configured with environment variable.
I want it to have tools for generating different type of QR codes (for example just text, or open web url, or connect to wifi).
Please also create a conprehensive README.md and example_mcp_config.json for me.

Be sure to implement using latest (^1.12.1) "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk" package.

Since we are using STDIO, do not print any logs at all.

As for details of how to create a MCP server. Please use prompt book mcp.
First activate the engineering prompt book, and the get the prompt for creating a mcp server.
