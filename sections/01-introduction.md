# Introduction

<v-clicks>

## Not in this Workshop
- No environment setup & No tutorial on how to configuration MCP server in MCP clients
- Less technical details and more analogies
- Focusing only on the "tool" capability of MCP server
- Find a developer to help
  - WeiHang, Lawrence and I are all MCP consultants for innofest
  - Other devs should be able to help you with the env and setup too

## Focus on
  - Understanding the concept
  - Demonstration on different use cases
    - help you understand the potential of MCP

            <p>Also, check my calendar and schedule some necessary meetings for me based on the emails. Be sure to check the attendees' calendar to avoid conflicts.</p>
            <p>Send the summary to me using telegram after you finish everything</p>
